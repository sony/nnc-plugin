XAI/RepresenterPointSelection
~~~~~~~~~~

Using a method called Representer Point Selection, the influence of the training images on  the test images are evaluated. 
The top-k influential samples are shown for a test data, which can be referred for understanding the basis for prediction. 
This plugin runs when using GPU.
Please see below for the detailed explanation of algorithm.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :class: longtable

   * - top_k
     - Specify the number of top-k influential training samples which are presented for a test sample.

   * - num-samples
     - Specify the number of presented test images.

   * - output
     - Specify the name of the CSV file to output the inference results to.
    
   * - model
     - Specify the pretrained model path (nnp file).

   * - input-train
     - Specify the training dataset CSV file containing image files for which influences are calculated.

   * - input-val
     - Specify the validation dataset CSV file containing image files for which influences are calculated.

   * - normalize
     - Specify the image normaliztion. 
     
   * - lmbd
     - Specify weight factor of l2.
   
   * - epoch
     - Specify the epochs of finetuning.


Output Information
===================

The result of this plugin is saved in the designated 'output' path as CSV file.
The information on the columns of CSV file is as follows.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 30 70
   :class: longtable

   * - test_sample
     - The test sample images

   * - label; pred
     - The test sample's label and predicted label. (label index)

   * - positive_x
     - the best (top-x) influential samples for prediction of test data.

   * - positive_x
     - the worst (top-x) influential samples for prediction of test data.
     
Notes
===================
This script is only valid for classification networks with an Affine Layer that has the number of output dimensions equal to the number of classes.
It does not work for regression analyses that use sigmoids.
